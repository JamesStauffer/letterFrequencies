Open Roget's 1.1
----------------
Thank you for downloading The Open Roget's Thesaurus.

-----
SETUP
-----
The data base can be found in roget_elkb.  This directory should be placed
in your home directory.

---------
EXECUTION
---------
This folder should also contain a jar called rogets.jar

To execute it using Java 1.5 used 
> java -jar rogets.jar
You may require crimson.jar.  It can be obtained at: http://xml.apache.org/crimson/
Another way to run the thesaurus is:
> java -cp rogets.jar ca.site.elkb.RogetELKB

------------
APPLICATIONS
------------
There are three applications, the driver, lexical Chains and semDist.  The driver can be
used to construct a new index that can be placed in the roget_elkb/1911 folder.  It is not
necessary to run this program to generate the index since it has been provided already.

The lexical Chains application builds lexical chains out of a file of text.  Executed:
java -cp .:../rogets.jar LexicalChain <input file>

The semDist application finds the semantic distance between pairs of words
java -cp .:../rogets.jar SemDist <input file>

The wordPower application picks the best synonym from a set of candidatest
java -cp .:../rogets.jar WordPower <input file>

The wordCluster application clusters groups of words (see radioactive_materials.txt and 
radioactive_materials_res.txt for file formats)
java -cp .:../rogets.jar WordCluster <input file> <output file>

All of these applications require rogets.jar and possibley crimson.jar (depending on your
system) to be in the path.

A Driver is included which can be used to rebuild the index.  We do not recommend using it
unless you know what you are doing.

DOCUMENTATION
